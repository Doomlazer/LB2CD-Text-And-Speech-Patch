# Laura Bow 2 CD Text and Speech Patch for DOSBox

This mod replaces the 100.scr amd 100.hep patch files in your lb2 game directory. It includes their changes, but back them up first if this is your only copy of the game. 

## Installation:

Move/copy all of the files in this folder into your Laura Bow 2 CD (version 1.1) game folder replacing the exsiting 100.scr and 100.hep files. Start normally in DOSBox.

The game begins with both speech and text enabled. Click the MODE button in the control panel to switch between TEXT, SPEECH, and BOTH.


This patch was origionally created for Threepwang's french translation of Laura Bow 2 CD. 

It references code from this forum post: https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=1577.msg8632#msg8632
