Laura bow 2 CD text & speech patch for DOSBox

by doomlazer

Do not use these patch files with ScummVM or you will be stuck in "both" mode forever - scumm already has a built-in "both" mode for this game anyway.

## Installation:

Move/copy all of the files in this folder into your Laura Bow 2 CD (version 1.1) game folder and start normally in DOSBox. The game starts with both speech and text enabled. Click the MODE button in the control panel to switch between TEXT, SPEECH, and BOTH.

This patch was origionally created for Threepwang's french translation of Laura Bow 2 CD. 

It references code from this forum post: https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=1577.msg8632#msg8632
