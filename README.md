Laura bow 2 CD text & speech patch for DOSBox

by doomlazer

### Do not use these patch files with ScummVM or you will not be able to  - it already has a built-in "both" mode for this game

## Installation: move/copy all of the files in this folder into your Laura Bow 2 CD (version 1.1) game folder and start normally in DOSBox. 

The game starts with both speech and text enabled. Click the MODE button in the control panel to switch between TEXT, SPEECH, and BOTH.
